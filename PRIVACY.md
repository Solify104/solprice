# Privacy Policy for Solana Price Converter

## Introduction
Solana Price Converter is a Chrome extension that fetches real-time SOL prices and converts prices on webpages to SOL. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection
- The extension does not collect or store any personal data from users.
- The extension makes requests to a proxy server (`https://solify-it-proxy.onrender.com`) to fetch SOL prices. The proxy server does not log or store any personally identifiable information.

## Data Usage
- The extension uses the `storage` permission to cache SOL prices locally on your device.
- The extension uses the `tabs` and `activeTab` permissions to access webpage content and convert prices to SOL.

## Third-Party Services
- The proxy server fetches SOL prices from CoinGecko and Binance APIs. These services may have their own privacy policies, which you can review at:
  - CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/privacy
  - Binance: https://www.binance.com/en/privacy
